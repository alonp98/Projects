# One Of My Jobs Had A Huge Issue!

I worked at an hourly wage job, but each shift, role, and time of the day had an impact on my hourly wage / bonuses.

so, during my CS studies, and to make a little implementaion of the topics I covered during my OOP course (which was taught in CPP), I decided to build my own daily wage calculator.
